# AdventOfCode2022

These are my solutions to the 2022 Advent of code.

In each day, I include the code, the test cases in the description, any other test cases I used, and my puzzle input.
However, I have not really given instructions on how to use them, although I mostly pass filenames in to the solution.
Part1 and Part2 are usually different methods - when checked in the Part1 is probably commented out.

I take no responsibility if you run this code and something awful happens - check it first.

In each day, I have taken the markup from the description and copied it here.  This is probably in breach
of copyright, but none of this is owned by me - it all comes from the brilliant [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl),
and the [Advent of Code 2022 website](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

Included in the markdown are my answers for the given input.  I have always assumed everyone gets a unique puzzle input,
although I am not sure about that.
