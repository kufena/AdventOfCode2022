## Why oh why oh why?

This is a retake of Day14, but instead of using an array to model the grid, just use
a hashset of points that are already occupied.

So far, I've only done this for Part1, and it gives the right answers.
Part2 shouldn't be too hard, but it was a proof of concept, because i always use an array as
the grid for these puzzles, and then Part2 says "what about an infinite grid?" and I go
whaaaaat?
There's always always a simple work around - some constraints that it'll never exceed, so you
can swizzle the array to hold it all, but without the array, surely it would be much easier?
